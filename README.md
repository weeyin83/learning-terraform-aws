# learning-terraform-aws

Sarah is learning Terraform and GitHub Actions with AWS. 

This repository contains a basic Terraform file that will deploy an EC2 instance using Ubuntu 22.04 and have Apache2 installed with a simple web page.  It also has port 8080 open. 

This is a demo and learning repository.
